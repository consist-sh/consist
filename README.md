> consist - (noun): a set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.

`consist` is the one person framework server scaffolder. You can use it to quickly
baseline a raw server using a given recipe provided by Consist. I use it to
baseline new Droplets to be ready to run Kamal in single server setup for
a Rails monolith.

## Quick start

```sh
gem install consist
```

You must be already auth'd with the server you want to scaffold. `consist` will use
your SSH id to perform actions.

Then:

```sh
consist scaffold <recipe_name> root <ip_address>
```

Will kick off the scaffolding of that given server with the given recipe.

## Rationale

I wanted a super-simple tool, that was baked in Ruby, for setting up
random servers to specific configurations. This is the result.

On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Terraform, this tool is basically
as low-rent you can get to hand running scripts yourself, so about a 3
on the scale.

If you know how to shell script what you want, you can stick it in a step,
and add it to a recipe.

### Why not use Terraform / Ansible / Salt etc?

Because I think they are bad tools that are overblown for my needs. I wanted something
I could hack on, and will work specifically without ambiguity. For example, Ansible
has a lot of nonsense with case sensitivity, Terraform does [weird unexpected things](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16330).

I also didn't want to maintain specific knowledge of these infrastructure
as code tools in my brain anymore, and all of their peculiarities and oddities.

If you like those tools, go ahead and use them. Use raw shell scripts if you want.

Ain't nobody stopping you.

## Key Concepts

Consist leans on two primary ideas: recipes and steps. Recipes contain one or more
steps. Steps tend to be atomic and idempotent.

Example of a recipe:

```ruby
name "Kamal Single Server"
description "Sets up a single server to run Kamal"
user :root

steps do
  step :update_apt_packages
  step :install_apt_packages
end
```

Example of a step:

```ruby
name "Install APT packages"
required_user :root

shell "Installing essential packages" do
  <<~EOS
    apt-get -y remove systemd-timesyncd
    timedatectl set-ntp no
    apt-get -y install build-essential curl fail2ban git ntp vim
    apt-get autoremove
    apt-get autoclean
  EOS
end

shell "Start NTP and Fail2Ban" do
  <<~EOS
    service ntp restart
    service fail2ban restart
  EOS
end
```

### Consistfile

I'm working on this right now. A `Consistfile` is a portable giant
file of a recipe and all its steps. Something like:

```ruby
consist do
  recipe :main do
    step :step1
    step :step2
    step :step3
    ...
  end

  step :step1 do
  ...
  end

  file :apt_auto_upgrades do
    <<~EOS
    APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
    APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
    EOS
  end
end
```

Given a `Consistfile` you could then say `consist up <ip_address>` and
it would just work.

## Is it good?

I think so. But I don't know, use your own brain or something. Don't listen to
me.
