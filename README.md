**THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. APIs AND FEATURES WILL CHANGE.**

> consist - (noun): a set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.

`consist` is the one person framework server scaffolder. It is stone age tech.

You can use it to quickly baseline a raw server using a given recipe provided
by Consist. I use it to baseline new Droplets to be ready to run Kamal in
single server setup for a Rails monolith. While Kamal will setup Docker
for you, it does not do anything else related to configuring the underlying
server, such as firewalls, general hardening, enabling swapfile etc.

## Project Principles

- Minimal tool specific language / knowledge required to use Consist
- Procedural declaration execution - no converging, orchestration or
  event driven operation
- If you can shell script it, you can consist it directly

## Quick start

```sh
gem install consist
```

You must be already auth'd with the server you want to scaffold. `consist` will use
your SSH id to perform actions.

Then, you have two ways of interacting with Consist. First is the `scaffold` command:

```sh
consist scaffold <recipe_name> root <ip_address>
```

Will kick off the scaffolding of that given server with the given
recipe, using the `root` user.

The other way of using `consist` is to go with a `Consistfile` in
your project root that describes the recipe and steps. Then you can say:

```sh
consist up <ip_address>
```

And `consist` will do it's thing with that given IP address.

## Features

- Simple Ruby based DSL
- ERB interpolation of config on shell commands and file contents
- Small API surface area - quick to learn

## Rationale

I wanted a super-simple tool, that was baked in Ruby, for setting up
random servers to specific configurations. This is the result.

On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Terraform, this tool is basically
as low-rent you can get to hand running scripts yourself, so about a 3
on the scale.

If you know how to shell script what you want, you can stick it in a step,
and add it to a recipe.

The more I work in this industry, the less I see using other people's code
and tools as a benefit, and more of a liability. I appreciate the paradox I'm
creating here for you ðŸ˜…

### Why not use Terraform / Ansible / Salt etc?

I think they are bad tools for my needs. I wanted something simple
I could hack on, grow only when needed, and will work specifically
without ambiguity. For example, Ansible has a lot of nonsense with case sensitivity,
Terraform does [weird unexpected things](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16330).

I didn't want to keep maintaining specific knowledge of these infrastructure
as code tools in my brain anymore, along with all of their peculiarities and oddities.

**If you prefer those tools, go ahead and use them.**

Ain't nobody stopping you.

## Key Concepts

Consist leans on three primary ideas: recipes, steps and files. Recipes contain
one or more steps. Steps tend to be atomic and idempotent.

### Recipes

Example of a recipe:

```ruby
name "Kamal Single Server"
description "Sets up a single server to run Kamal"
user :root

steps do
  step :update_apt_packages
  step :install_apt_packages
end
```

### Steps

Example of a step:

```ruby
name "Install APT packages"
required_user :root

shell "Installing essential packages" do
  <<~EOS
    apt-get -y remove systemd-timesyncd
    timedatectl set-ntp no
    apt-get -y install build-essential curl fail2ban git ntp vim
    apt-get autoremove
    apt-get autoclean
  EOS
end

shell "Start NTP and Fail2Ban" do
  <<~EOS
    service ntp restart
    service fail2ban restart
  EOS
end
```

### Files

Example of a file:

```ruby
file :hostname do
  <<~EOS
  <%= hostname %>
  EOS
end
```

### Consistfile

A `Consistfile` is a portable giant file of a recipe and all its
steps. Something like (this is a _full_ example, in practice you
would reference some of Consist's built in steps):

```ruby
consist do
  config :hostname, "testexample.com"
  config :site_fqdn, "textexample.com"
  config :admin_email, "j@jmd.fm"
  config :swap_size, "2G"
  config :swap_swappiness, "60"
  config :timezone, "UTC"

  file :apt_auto_upgrade do
    <<~EOS
      APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
      APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
      APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
    EOS
  end

  file :hostname do
    <<~EOS
      <%= hostname %>
    EOS
  end

  file :timezone do
    <<~EOS
      <%= timezone %>
    EOS
  end

  file :fail2ban_config do
    <<~EOS
      # Fail2Ban configuration file.
      #

      # to view current bans, run one of the following:
      # fail2ban-client status ssh
      # iptables --list -n | fgrep DROP

      # The DEFAULT allows a global definition of the options. They can be overridden
      # in each jail afterwards.

      [DEFAULT]

Given a `Consistfile` you could then say `consist up <ip_address>` and
it would just work.

## Is it good?
